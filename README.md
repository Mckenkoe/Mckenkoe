  I'm a recent graduate with a BSc in Computer Science with a concentration in web development. I love both the design and development processes, so I split my time between learning new web frameworks and UX/UI design. I'm currently learning React so I can improve the vibe and experience of my projects. My newest project is creating art portfolio websites to help artists display their artwork.
